# Armstrong-Perfect-Numbers

More than 2500 years ago, mathematicians got interested in numbers. 

**Armstrong Numbers**
The number 153 has the odd property that 13+53 + 33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153. Namely, 153 is equal to the sum of the cubes of its own digits. 

**Perfect Numbers**
A number is said to be perfect if it is the sum of its own divisors (excluding itself).  For example, 6 is perfect since 1, 2, and 3 divide evenly into 6 and 1+ 2 + 3 = 6. 

*Input File* 
The input is taken from a file named number.in and which a sequence of numbers, one per line, terminated by a line containing the number 0.

*Output File* 
All the numbers read from the input file, are printed one per line followed by a sentence indicating whether the number is or is not Armstrong number and whether it is or is not a perfect number.

Sample Input
```
153
6
0
```

Sample Output
```
153 is an Armstrong number but it is not a perfect number. 
6 is not an Armstrong number but it is a perfect number.
```
